-Projectâ€™s assumptions
The main part of the program orchestrates the functionality of a digital sliding puzzle game implemented on an Arduino platform. The game involves an initial setup phase where communication with the user is established through a serial interface (UART), and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is initialized. A welcoming message briefly appears on the LCD.

The puzzle board is then set up with a predefined configuration, representing an initial scrambled state. Each tile on the board is labeled with a letter ('A' to 'I'), and one tile is intentionally left empty, allowing for movement. 

The program enters a continuous loop, waiting for user input via the UART interface. Users can send commands ('W', 'A', 'S', 'D') to manipulate the empty tile and attempt to rearrange the tiles into the correct order. 

Upon receiving a valid command, the program updates the puzzle board and refreshes the LCD to display the current state of the puzzle. The game continuously checks if the puzzle has been successfully solved after each move. If the puzzle is complete, a victory message is displayed on the LCD, prompting the player to press a button to restart the game.

The game restart involves resetting the puzzle to a new random configuration, and the LCD is cleared to begin a new round of the sliding puzzle challenge. In essence, the main part of the program manages user interaction, puzzle state updates, victory conditions, and game resets, providing an engaging and interactive experience for the player.
